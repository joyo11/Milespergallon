# Miles Per Gallon (MPG) Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of cars based on various features such as engine size, weight, number of cylinders, etc. The model is built using machine learning techniques and can be deployed to Google Cloud AI Platform for prediction tasks.

## Project Structure
- `mpg_model.pkl`: The trained machine learning model used for predicting MPG.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joyo11/miles-per-gallon.git
   cd miles-per-gallon
